This repository demonstrates an unusual CSS bug related to clearing floats when the container's width is not explicitly specified. The bug occurs when the floated elements do not occupy the full width of their parent container, causing unexpected rendering behavior.  The solution shows how to correctly clear the floats and ensure proper layout, even with implicit container widths.
